        <h1>About Me</h1> 
	<p>Hello! This page is dedicated to me! I am interested in being a programmer! <br>
	This is my first year at Edison High School, and I am greatly enjoying it! I am part of the robotics club, which is called Mindcraft. Our team number is 3495. <br>
	During my 8th grade year, I went to the Tournament of Technology to present a movie that my friends and I filmed and created. We ended up winning first prize in the movie production category!</p>
