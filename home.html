        <h1 align="center">About Me</h1> 
	<p>Hello! This page is dedicated to me, a 14 year old teen that loves to code, although I am new to it. I am interested in being a programmer. This is my first year at Edison High School, and I am greatly enjoying it! I am part of the robotics club, which is called Mindcraft. Our team number is 3495. I am currently learning programing in the club, and I think that I have learned a lot for a freshmen. I may not know that much about coding in general, but I think that with commitment, I will be able to become a great programmer! During my 8th grade year, I went to the Tournament of Technology to present a movie that my friends and I filmed and created. We ended up winning first prize in the movie production category! I also participated in a summer course at Bitwise. In this course, I was able to learn how to code games using Unity. One of the games that I created was a side scroller.</p>
