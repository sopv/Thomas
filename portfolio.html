        <h1>About Me</h1> 
	<p>This page is dedicated to everything I have done in my computer science pathway. </p>
	<p>Our first project was Lightbot! In Lightbot, we used block code to advance a tiny robot through stages filled with obstacles. Lightbot is a game created under the Hour of Code program. I would reccomend this to beginners with code. I personally enjoyed Lightbot, and I think beginners would to! </p>

	<p>Our second project was Scratch! In scratch, we used block code to program games, scenes, and videos. The things makeable in Scratch range from basic learning games to full on games that have multiple things to do in them. The good thing about Scratch is that if you don't know what to create, you can explore projects created by other people and remix those to make them your own! </p>
