        <h1>My Projects</h1> 
	<p>This page is dedicated to everything I have done in my computer science pathway. </p>
	<p>Our first project was Lightbot! In Lightbot, we used block code to advance a tiny robot through stages filled with obstacles. Lightbot is a game created under the Hour of Code program. I would reccomend this to beginners with code. I personally enjoyed Lightbot, and I think beginners would to! </p>

	<p>Our second project was Scratch! In Scratch, we used block code to program games, scenes, and videos. The things makeable in Scratch range from basic learning games to full on games that have multiple things to do in them. The good thing about Scratch is that if you don't know what to create, you can explore projects created by other people and remix those to make them your own! </p>

	<p>Our third project was App Inventor! In App Inventor, we once again used block code to create apps. Just like Scratch, there is a wide variety of projects that others created that you have access to. A group of three others and I created an app that gave college students ideas for cheap and healthy foods. I think App Inventor would also be good for beginners!  </p>

	<p>Our fourth project was Khan Academy! In Khan Academy, we took lessons on html in order to learn how to do stuff like this website! I learned so much throught Khan Academy, and if people take the time to watch the videos and complete the lessons, then they can too! If you have no experience at all with code, I would highly recommened the lessons in Khan Academy, they really do help you!  </p>

	<p>Our fifth project was Notepad++! In Notepad++, we used what we learned in Khan Academy and coded webpages using html! I created the ice and index pages using this program. We only used Notepad++ for a while, but I learned a lot from it! We just switched from Notepad++ to GitHub so that we can enhance our websites. I would reccomend Notepad++ to beginners with some experience in html. </p>

	<p>Our sixth project is GitHub, which is what we are currently working on. GitHub is like Notepad++, but we have much more freedom to do things with what we code. We can do things such as create websites, which is what I am doing right now! Almost everything in this website was made with GitHub! I think that GitHub is a great website for people that would like to learn web development and to get some more practice with their html skills! </p>

	<p>Continuing into the pathway, we began to use a program called Canopy. Canopy is an offline program that allows the user to code using python, a coding language. We have made three games using Canopy, being a guessing the number game, a lucky seven game, and a hangman game. I personally enjoyed making these projects using python.
