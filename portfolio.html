        <h1>About Me</h1> 
	<p>This page is dedicated to everything I have done in my computer science pathway. </p>
	<p>Our first project was Lightbot! In Lightbot, we used block code to advance a tiny robot through stages filled with obstacles. Lightbot is a game created under the Hour of Code program. I would reccomend this to beginners with code. I personally enjoyed Lightbot, and I think beginners would to! </p>

	<p>Our second project was Scratch! In Scratch, we used block code to program games, scenes, and videos. The things makeable in Scratch range from basic learning games to full on games that have multiple things to do in them. The good thing about Scratch is that if you don't know what to create, you can explore projects created by other people and remix those to make them your own! </p>

	<p>Our third project was App Inventor! In App Inventor, we once again used block code to create apps. Just like Scratch, there is a wide variety of projects that others created that you have access to. A group of three others and I created an app that gave college students ideas for cheap and healthy foods. I think App Inventor would also be good for beginners!  </p>

	<p>Our fourth project was Khan Academy! In Khan Academy, we took lessons on html in order to learn how to do stuff like this!  </p>
